## binary search
- Key words:
find, sorted
- Three templates
1. when loop ends, start + 1 = end
```
start, end = 0, len(n) - 1
while start + 1 < end: 
    mid = start + (end - start) // 2
    if nums[mid] < target:
        start = mid
    else:
        end = mid
```
2. When loop ends, start = end
```
start, end = 0, len(n)
while start < end: # when loop ends, start = end
    mid = start + (end - start) // 2
    if nums[mid] < target:
        start = mid + 1
    else:
        end = mid
```
3. when loop ends, start = end + 1
```
start, end = 0, len(n) - 1
while start <= end: 
    mid = start + (end - start) // 2
    if nums[mid] < target:
        start = mid + 1
    else:
        end = mid - 1
```
- My template:
    - strictly increasing find last one smaller than or equal to target
    ```
    start, end = 0, len(n) - 1  # use start = -1 or end = len(n) if returning -1 or len(n) is possible
    def bs(nums, start, end, target):
        if start == end:
            return start
        mid = start + (end - start + 1) // 2 # because start = mid, has to + 1 to shift to end or will be endless loop
        if nums[mid] > target: # use >, >=, <, <= based on specific case
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid
        return bs(nums, start, end, target)
    ```
    - strictly increasing find first one larger than or equal to target
    ```
    start, end = 0, len(n) - 1
    def bs(nums, start, end, target):
        if start == end:
            return start
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2 # because end = mid, don't + 1 to shift to start or will be endless loop
        if nums[mid] < target:
            start = mid + 1
        else:
            end = mid
        return bs(nums, start, end, target)
    ```
- tips
    - prevents int overflow:

        use:
        ```
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        ```
        not:
        ```
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        ```

    - merge intervals: see "## sweep line"

## Bitwise Operation
- AND
    - tricks:
        - x & 1: get the rightmost bit
        - x & (x - 1): remove rightmost 1
        - x & (x - 1) == 0: tests if x is the power of two
    - eg. 190-Reverse Bits; 191-Number of 1 Bits; 201-Bitwise AND of Numbers Range; 231-Power of Two; 342-Power of Four; 338-Counting Bits
- XOR
    - definition - same: 0, different: 1

        - a number XOR itself equals 0: 136-Single Number; 137-Single Number II; 268-Missing Number
        - Subarray containing chars with certain conditions
            - tips: memoize the state of all prefixes in a hashmap, compute state using XOR
            - eg: 1371(even/odd),1542
        - Pure XOR: 1442,

        - eg: 187-Repeated DNA Sequences; 287-Find the Duplicate Number; 318-Maximum Product of Word Lengths; 1284-Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix (bfs)
    - enumeration (can be solved using backtracking):
        - eg: 90-Subsets II; 464-Can I Win; 491-Increasing Subsequences; 526-Beautiful Arrangement; 698-Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets; 1386-Cinema Seat Allocation; 1593-Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings; 1681-Minimum Incompatibility

## BFS
- key word: shorted path (eg. 1345); 
- algorithm:
    elements: queue, visited hashset; 
    steps: while q, if q popped is target, finish, if not, add popped item's neighbors to the q; optimization: visited can be eliminated if allowed to change memory (mark on original data)
- problems:
    - all shortest paths: 301
    - 1D (array): 1654-Minimum Jumps to Reach Home; 279-Perfect Squares
    - 2D shortest paths: 505-The Maze II;542-01 Matrix; 317-Shortest Distance from All Buildings(hard); 909-Snakes and Ladders(1d conversion); 994-Rotting Oranges; 1091-Shortest Path in Binary Matrix; 1284-Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix (hard); 1293-Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination (hard)
    - String: 752-Open the Lock
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm:
        - key words: minimal cost of paths (unlike regular shortest path where cost is always 1, each connection can have various cost)
        - caveat: visited.add() happens at node pop, not node push, since shortest cost is found when node with the smallest cost pops, when pushing a node we could push one with cost larger than smallest cost
        - intuition: similar as bfs, difference is that instead of using a queue and always pop left (which is by default the minimal cost), use a heap to store tuple (total_cost, node) to always pop the smallest cost; also need an array/map to memoize smallest cost to each node; IMPORTANT - the use of heap guarantees that a node with smallest price route always popped first (no matter how many stops it takes to arrive at it) 
        - eg. 743-Network Delay Time (classic); 505-The Maze II; 787-Cheapest Flights Within K Stops; 407-Trapping Rain Water II (implicit); 656-Coin Path(hard, TLE); 1368-Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid(have better solutions using dfs)
    - tree traversal: see "## Tree"
    - construct sequence with topological sort (see "## Topological Sort")
    - bidrectional dfs
        - purpose: speeding up bfs
        - patterns: use two sets to store current nodes visited from beginning and end layers; for each round of bfs, search from the set with fewer nodes
        - 127-Word Ladder|126-Word Ladder II(hard); 1197-Minimum Knight Moves; 1345-Jump Game IV
    - not only min distance, but need routes with min distance:
        - eg: 126-Word Ladder II

- tip: cache previous result to save time
- eg: 418-Sentence Screen Fitting

## Counter

## Data Structure Implementation 
- summary: implement a data structure with required APIs and targeted complexity
- problems: 
    - hashset/hashmap implementation:

## DFS - don't forget to reset visited back when all the branched dfs does not succeed.
- recursive (in-order)
```
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return
        dfs(node.left)
        print(node.val)
        dfs(node.right)
```
- iterative (in-order)
```
    stack = []
    while stack or node:
        if node:
            stack.append(node)
            node = node.left
        else:
            node = stack.pop()
            print(node.val)
            node = node.right
```
or 
```

            node = node.left
        node = stack.pop()
        print(node.val)
        node = node.right
```

```
    node = root        
    while node:
        if node.left:
            temp = node.left
            while temp.right and temp.right != node:
                temp = temp.right
            if not temp.right: # when looking for prev, attach temp.right to node
                temp.right, node = node, node.left
                continue
            # when traversal, detach temp.right from node
            temp.right = None
        print(node.val)
        node = node.right

## Dynamic programming -
backtracking with memoization; steps: build dp memory, define what dp[i] represents, find update function(s)
space can be optimized to O(1) if only need to track constant time of variables for each update
- Top down (depth-first-search): recursion using memoization
- Bottom up: loop using memoization (calculate those won't change first, eg.1143, 1340) - look at the transformation formula from the top-down solution to figure out what needs to be calculated first in the loop. Can use the subproblem size as the outer loop if dp(i, j) need dp(i + 1, j - 1) (eg.312ï¼Œ375, 486, 877, 1312)
- problems:

        - eg. 3-Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | 159-Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters | 340-Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters | 992-Subarrays with K Different Integers | 395-Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters; 76,1234; similar:904;1004-Max Consecutive Ones III;1248-Count Number of Nice Subarrays (loose end); 1358-Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters; 1371-Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts; 1438-Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit(hard); 1839-Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order; 1658-Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero
    - subarray sum with a target: sliding window with prefix-sum / two pointers
        - eg: 209-Minimum Size Subarray Sum; 713-Subarray Product Less Than K; 930-Binary Subarrays With Sum; 1658-Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero
    - use a sliding window to keep the running sum of last n items: 837-New 21 Game
    - largest size of subsequence with in target diff: 
        - tip: sort first
        - eg. 1610-Maximum Number of Visible Points(hard, 2D)
    - monotonic queue: 
        - intuition: keep track of the max/min in window when window size is large; can be more effiecient than the solution using a priority queue which has a complexity of O(nlogk) where k is the window size (eg.1499).
        - algorithm: 
            - after popleft() indexes out of range, q[0] is the next smallest/largest in eligible window
            - after pop() indexes i with nums[i] >(<) nums[curr_i], append curr_i to q as next candidate.
        - complexity: O(n), O(n) - each item queued and popped exactly once
        - eg. 239-Sliding Window Maximum; 656. Coin Path(hard); 862-Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K; 1425-Constrained Subsequence Sum; 1438-Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit(two queues); 1499-Max Value of Equation; 1696-Jump Game VI

## Sorting
- quick sort 
    - algorithm: (classic eg.215)
        1. find a random pivot
        2. put the pivot in its sorted position (elements to its left are smaller and elements to its right are greater)
        3. recursively sort the left and the right partition
    - Complexity:
        O(nlogn) on average; O(n^2) worst case
        O(1) space (in-place sorting)
    - variations:
        quick select: 
            - key word: get largest/smallest k
            - complexity: O(n) on average since only sorting one partition; O(n^2) worst case
            - eg.215-Kth_Largest_Element_in_an_Array, 973-K Closest Points to Origin
- merge sort: 
    - algorithm:
        1. recursively call merge_sort on left half, then on right half
        2. merge left half and right half
    - Complexity:
        time: O(nlogn)
        space: O(n) - number of nodes in the recursion tree, can be O(1) if using iterative method
    - Examples: 148-Sort List(LinkedList); 315-Count of Smaller Numbers After Self(hard)

    - eg: 953-Verifying an Alien Dictionary
- python SortedList:
    - eg. 220-Contains Duplicate III
- next larger element:
    - eg.31-Next Permutation; 556-Next Greater Element III

## Stack
- problems:
    - straight forward stack:
        - eg: 071-Simplify_Path; 388-Longest Absolute File Path; 636-Exclusive Time of Functions; 716-Max Stack(hard); 735-Asteroid Collision; 1047-Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String; 1209-Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II;

        - smallest/largest number formed by subsequence:
            -eg. 1673-Find the Most Competitive Subsequence; 402-Remove K Digits
        - window max/min (with monotonically increasing/decreasing stack)
            - intuition: it is very useful to get "next bigger item", "next smaller item", "previous bigger item", "previous smaller item" and therefore "window max" and "window min"
            - eg: 42-Trapping Rain Water(11); 84-Largest Rectangle in Histogram(hard)|85-Maximal Rectangle; 768-Max Chunks To Make Sorted II; 907-Sum of Subarray Minimums; 1856-Maximum Subarray Min-Product(similar:907); 962-Maximum Width Ramp|1124-Longest Well-Performing Interval

    - problems:
        - string manipulation:

## Topological Sort:
    - algorithm: 
        1. build node graph and increase indegrees
        2. add nodes with indegrees == 0 to queue
        3. while q, pop node and bfs search neighbors of nodes, decrease their indegrees by 1, if indegree turns to 0, append to q
    - key words: construct sequence
    - eg: 207-Course Schedule | 210. Course Schedule II | 1462-Course Schedule IV; 310-Minimum Height Trees; 444-Sequence Reconstruction; 269-Alien Dictionary(hard); 2115-Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies

    - sliding window (see "## sliding window")

## Tree - Recursion can usually be used. 
- If using dfs, has to decide which to use: in-order traversal (aka. dfs), post-order traversal (549,1740), and pre-order traversal (298, search tree). Time complexity is O(n): every node is visited once. Space complexity is O(n) in worst case and O(log(n)) in average case: The extra space comes from implicit stack space due to recursion. For a skewed binary tree, the recursion could go up to n levels deep. If asks for a balanced tree, the space complexity is O(logn) (eg.109)
If using bfs, usually uses a FIFO queue to store nodes to be visited. 
- Problems:
    - dfs:
        - pre-order: 95-Unique Binary Search Trees II(hard); 100-Same Tree; 114-Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List(recursive/iterative); 112-Path Sum; 156-Binary Tree Upside Down; 297-Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree; 449.

    - BST(Binary Search Tree): 
        - a node needs to be larger than the largest node in its left subtree and smaller than the smallest node in its right subtree (eg.333, 1373)
        - tip: inorder traversal yields a sorted list
        - eg. 95-Unique Binary Search Trees II(hard); 109-Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree; 173-Binary Search Tree Iterator(iterative); 235-Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree; 285-Inorder Successor in BST(classic); 272-Closest Binary Search Tree Value II(hard); *333-Largest BST Subtree; 653-Two Sum IV - Input is a BST; 938.

## TreeMap
- supported in Python using SortedDict (sorted map with O(logn) insertion/deletion)
```
from sortedcontainers import SortedDict
treemap = SortedDict({})
treemap.setdefault(x, [])
treemap[x].append(1)
treemap.peekitem(-1)[0] # peek largest key
treemap[x] # [1] get value
```
- eg: 716-Max Stack; 2034-Stock Price Fluctuation

## Trie
- when to use: Trie could use less space compared to hashmap when storing many keys with the same prefix (word search, spell checker, etc.)
- Trie data structure
```
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.isWord = False # mark word end
        self.children = collections.defaultdict(TrieNode)
```
- tips: use dfs to get all strings that start with the given prefix (can store whole sentence at the end node - eg.642)
- eg: 211-Design Add and Search Words Data Structure(basic); 139-Word Break|140-Word Break II; 616-Add Bold Tag in String; 642-Design Search Autocomplete System; 745-Prefix and Suffix Search(2 Tries);

## Union Find
- key word: connected group in a graph
- algorithm: union find by rank (assign node with higher rank as parent of a connected group)
- complexity: nlog(n) to union all n elements - see [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find-algorithm-set-2-union-by-rank/)
```
parents = [i for i in range(n)]
        
def find(x):
    if parents[x] != x:
        parents[x] = find(parents[x]) # recursion
    return parents[x]

# simple version: when only need to find pair-wise connection (don't need a universal parent for all items in a connected part)
def union(x, y):
    px, py = find(x), find(y)
    if px != py: # connect parents of x, y
        parents[px] = py

# todo: full verion - assign parents by rank (guarantees that all connected items have the same parent)

def isXandYConnected(n):
    if shouldConnectXandY(x, y):
        union(x, y)
    
    return find(x) == find(y) # bubble up to parents
