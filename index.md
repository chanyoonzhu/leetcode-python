    - 1D array: 1562-Find Latest Group of Size M(hard)
    - 2D array: 1706-Where Will the Ball Fall

## binary search
- Key words:
find, sorted
- Three templates
1. when loop ends, start + 1 = end
```
start, end = 0, len(n) - 1
while start + 1 < end: 
    mid = start + (end - start) // 2
    if nums[mid] < target:
        start = mid
    else:
        end = mid
```
2. When loop ends, start = end
```
start, end = 0, len(n)
while start < end: # when loop ends, start = end
    mid = start + (end - start) // 2
    if nums[mid] < target:
        start = mid + 1
    else:
        end = mid
```
3. when loop ends, start = end + 1
```
start, end = 0, len(n) - 1
while start <= end: 
    mid = start + (end - start) // 2
    if nums[mid] < target:
        start = mid + 1
    else:
        end = mid - 1
```
- My template:
    - strictly increasing find last one smaller than or equal to target
    ```
    start, end = 0, len(n) - 1  # use start = -1 or end = len(n) if returning -1 or len(n) is possible
    def bs(nums, start, end, target):
        if start == end:
            return start
        mid = start + (end - start + 1) // 2 # because start = mid, has to + 1 to shift to end or will be endless loop
        if nums[mid] > target: # use >, >=, <, <= based on specific case
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid
        return bs(nums, start, end, target)
    ```
    - strictly increasing find first one larger than or equal to target
    ```
    start, end = 0, len(n) - 1
    def bs(nums, start, end, target):
        if start == end:
            return start
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2 # because end = mid, don't + 1 to shift to start or will be endless loop
        if nums[mid] < target:
            start = mid + 1
        else:
            end = mid
        return bs(nums, start, end, target)
    ```
- tips
    - prevents int overflow:

        use:
        ```
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        ```
        not:
        ```
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        ```
- Examples: 57,911,1146(bisect), 278,374-Guess Number Higher or Lower(basic), 981(strictly increasing, find lower), 315
- problems:
    - binary search the answer: get the possible range of answer, binary search between range and see if current number can satisfy condition using greedy algorithm
        - eg: 287-Find the Duplicate Number; 410-Split Array Largest Sum|774; 778-Swim in Rising Water(graph)|875|1011|1231|1283|1300|1482|1552|1648|1802(complex)|1870;1723-Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs(hard, with backtracking); 279-Perfect Squares
    - multiplication/division: 29-Divide Two Integers
    - arrays: 
        - find target:
            eg. 34-Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array; 162-Find Peak Element (unsorted)
        - rotated arrays:
            - tip: when there are duplicates, add duplicates removal steps (154, 81)
            - eg. 153-Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array|154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II|33-Search in Rotated Sorted Array|81-Search in Rotated Sorted Array II; 
        - merge arrays:
            - eg. 4-Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Bitwise Operation
- AND
    - tricks:
        - x & 1: get the rightmost bit
        - x & (x - 1): remove rightmost 1
    - eg. 190-Reverse Bits; 191-Number of 1 Bits; 231-Power of Two; 342-Power of Four; 338-Counting Bits
- XOR
    - definition - same: 0, different: 1
    - problems:
        - a number XOR itself equals 0: 136-Single Number; 137-Single Number II; 268-Missing Number
        - Subarray containing chars with certain conditions
            - tips: memoize the state of all prefixes in a hashmap, compute state using XOR
            - eg: 1371(even/odd),1542
        - Pure XOR: 1442,
        - Addition: 371-Sum of Two Integers
        - Bit difference/similarity: 461-Hamming Distance; 693-Binary Number with Alternating Bits
        - flip the bit: 476-Number Complement
- Bit shift
    - multiplication: 29-Divide Two Integers


## Bit-masking
- problems:
    - compression/serialization:
        - eg: 287-Find the Duplicate Number; 318-Maximum Product of Word Lengths; 1284-Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix (bfs)
    - enumeration (can be solved using backtracking):
        - eg: 90-Subsets II; 491-Increasing Subsequences; 698-Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets; 1593-Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings; 1681-Minimum Incompatibility

## BFS
- key word: shorted path (eg. 1345); 
- algorithm:
    elements: queue, visited hashset; 
    steps: while q, if q popped is target, finish, if not, add popped item's neighbors to the q; optimization: visited can be eliminated if allowed to change memory (mark on original data)
- problems:
    - all shortest paths: 301
    - 1D (array): 1654-Minimum Jumps to Reach Home; 279-Perfect Squares
    - 2D shortest paths: 505-The Maze II;542-01 Matrix; 1284-Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix (hard); 1293-Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination (hard)
    - String: 752-Open the Lock
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm:
        - key words: minimal cost of paths (unlike regular shortest path where cost is always 1, each connection can have various cost)
        - intuition: similar as bfs, difference is that instead of using a queue and always pop left (which is by default the minimal cost), use a heap to store tuple (total_cost, node) to always pop the smallest cost; also need an array/map to memoize smallest cost to each node
        - eg. 743-Network Delay Time (classic); 505-The Maze II; 787-Cheapest Flights Within K Stops; 407-Trapping Rain Water II (implicit); 656-Coin Path(hard, TLE)
    - tree traversal: see "## Tree"
    - construct sequence with topological sort (see "## Topological Sort")
    - bidrectional dfs
        - purpose: speeding up bfs
        - patterns: use two sets to store current nodes visited from beginning and end layers; for each round of bfs, search from the set with fewer nodes
        - 127-Word Ladder|126-Word Ladder II(hard); 1345-Jump Game IV
    - not only min distance, but need routes with min distance:
        - eg: 126-Word Ladder II

## Cache
- tip: cache previous result to save time
- eg: 418-Sentence Screen Fitting

## Counter
    eg: 900-RLE Iterator; 1419-Minimum Number of Frogs Croaking

## Divide and Conquer
- problems:
    - find subarrays with conditions:
        - eg: 53-Maximum Subarray

## Data Structure Implementation 
- summary: implement a data structure with required APIs and targeted complexity
- problems: 
    - hashset/hashmap implementation:
        - modulo with linkedlist/bst
        - eg: 705-Design HashSet, 706-Design HashMap
    - hashmap / doubly linked list: 146,380,381,432,460,1146,1381
    - stack: 
        155-Min Stack
    - heap: 295
    - Fenwick tree / segment tree: 307,308,327
- tips:
    use hashmap to achieve O(1) retrieval of a key
    use hashmap and doubly linked list to achieve retrieving min/max in O(1) eg:(LRU/LFU)146,432,460
    use Fenwick tree or Segment tree to solve range sum/max/min problem

## DFS - don't forget to reset visited back when all the branched dfs does not succeed.
- recursive (in-order)
```
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return
        dfs(node.left)
        print(node.val)
        dfs(node.right)
```
- iterative (in-order)
```
    stack = []
    while stack or node:
        if node:
            stack.append(node.left)
            node = node.left
        else:
            node = stack.pop()
            print(node.val)
            node = node.right
```
or 
```
    stack = []
    while stack or node:
        while node:
            stack.append(node.left)
            node = node.left
        node = stack.pop()
        print(node.val)
        node = node.right
```
- Inorder Morris*: O(n), O(1); eg.99
```
    node = root        
    while node:
        if node.left:
            temp = node.left
            while temp.right and temp.right != node:
                temp = temp.right
            if not temp.right: # when looking for prev, attach temp.right to node
                temp.right, node = node, node.left
                continue
            # when traversal, detach temp.right from node
            temp.right = None
        print(node.val)
        node = node.right

```
- Complexity: 
    - Time: O(n) - one visit each node
    - Space: O(n) - n stacks for skewed tree
- example: 230, 337; 690-Employee Importance; 778-Swim in Rising Water

## 2D DFS/BFS
- problems:
    - map hidden graph
        - eg: 1778-Shortest Path in a Hidden Grid; 1810-Minimum Path Cost in a Hidden Grid
    - find contiguous "islands"
        - eg: 200-Number of Islands | 694-Number of Distinct Islands | 1254-Number of Closed Islands | 934-Shortest Bridge (bfs + dfs); 959-Regions Cut By Slashes (need pixelating); 803-Bricks Falling When Hit (hard)
    - operation chaining:
        - eg: 399-Evaluate Division
    - other: 1766-Tree of Coprimes (hard)

## Dynamic programming -
backtracking with memoization; steps: build dp memory, define what dp[i] represents, find update function(s)
space can be optimized to O(1) if only need to track constant time of variables for each update
- Top down (depth-first-search): recursion using memoization
- Bottom up: loop using memoization (calculate those won't change first, eg.1143, 1340) - look at the transformation formula from the top-down solution to figure out what needs to be calculated first in the loop. Can use the subproblem size as the outer loop if dp(i, j) need dp(i + 1, j - 1) (eg.312ï¼Œ375, 486, 877, 1312)
- problems:
    - dp[i] depends on dp[i-1]: 
        - eg.70-Climbing Stairs; 198-House Robber|213. House Robber II||740-Delete and Earn; 256-Paint House|265-Paint House II; 276-Paint Fence(a hard medium); 413-Arithmetic Slices; 91-Decode Ways;139-Word Break; 837-New 21 Game; 940-Distinct Subsequences II
    - dp[i] depends on dp[j] where j in [1...i]:
        - eg. 64-Minimum Path Sum; 542-01 Matrix; 221-Maximal Square | 1277-Count Square Submatrices with All Ones; 931-Minimum Falling Path Sum | 1937-Maximum Number of Points with Cost; (revisit above examples!) 940. Distinct Subsequences II; 1105-Filling Bookcase Shelves
    - dp[i][j] depends on dp[i+1][j-1]:
        - tip: use subproblem size (diff between i and j) as the outer loop
        - eg: 312-Burst Balloons(hard)ï¼Œ375-Guess Number Higher or Lower II; 486, 516-Longest Palindromic Subsequence, 877, 1312
    - intervals: sequence needs to be divided into k distinct intervals
        - key words: split array
        - dp[i][k] depends on dp[j][k-1] where j = [1...i]
        - eg: 410-Split Array Largest Sum; 813-Largest Sum of Averages; 1278-Palindrome Partitioning III; 1335-Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule
    - two sequences:
        - key words: longeest common subsequences, shortest common superseequence, edit distance, ...
        - tip: dp[i][j] result at s1[:i1+1] and s2[:i2+1]
        - eg.
            - longeest common subsequences/shortest common superseequence: 97-Interleaving String; 115-Distinct Subsequences; 727. Minimum Window Subsequence; 1143-Longest Common Subsequence; 1092-Shortest Common Supersequence
            - edit distance: 72-Edit Distance; 583-Delete Operation for Two Strings|712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings; 1216-Valid Palindrome III|1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome; 1548-The Most Similar Path in a Graph
            - palindrome: 516-Longest Palindromic Subsequence, 1216-Valid Palindrome III|1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome
        - advanced: ask to track path

        - eg: 1610-Maximum Number of Visible Points

## Pre-computing:
- problems:
    - Calculation with certain restrictions: precompute partial results
        - eg: 238-Product of Array Except Self
    - Saving compute time
        - eg: 303-Range Sum Query - Immutable

    - queue with conditions: 1882-Process Tasks Using Servers
    - sorting:
        - eg: 23-Merge k Sorted Lists; 373-Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums|1439-Find the Kth Smallest Sum of a Matrix With Sorted Rows; 632-Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists; 778-Swim in Rising Water; 1675-Minimize Deviation in Array

## Sliding window -
- problems:
    - fixed length sliding window:

    - substring that has given numbers of certain characters: 
        - algorithm: move right pointer to right until satisfies condition, then move left pointer to right to tighten window until condition not satisfied
        - eg. 3-Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | 159-Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters | 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters | 992-Subarrays with K Different Integers | 395.

    - use a sliding window to keep the running sum of last n items: 837-New 21 Game
    - largest size of subsequence with in target diff: 
        - tip: sort first
        - eg. 1610-Maximum Number of Visible Points(hard, 2D)
    - monotonic queue: 
        - intuition: keep track of the max/min in window when window size is large; can be more effiecient than the solution using a priority queue which has a complexity of O(nlogk) where k is the window size (eg.1499).
        - algorithm: 
            - after popleft() indexes out of range, q[0] is the next smallest/largest
            - after pop() indexes i with nums[i] >(<) nums[curr_i], append curr_i to q as next candidate.
        - complexity: O(n), O(n) - each item queued and popped exactly once
        - eg. 239-Sliding Window Maximum; 656. Coin Path(hard); 862-Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K; 1438-Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit(two queues); 1499-Max Value of Equation; 1696-Jump Game VI

## Sorting
- quick sort 
    - algorithm:
        1. find a random pivot
        2. put the pivot in its sorted position (elements to its left are smaller and elements to its right are greater)
        3. recursively sort the left and the right partition
    - Complexity:
        O(nlogn) on average; O(n^2) worst case
        O(1) space (in-place sorting)
    - variations:
        quick select: eg.215, 973 O(n) on average since only sorting one partition; O(n^2) worst case
- merge sort: 
    - algorithm:
        1. recursively call merge_sort on left half, then on right half
        2. merge left half and right half
    - Complexity:
        time: O(nlogn)
        space: O(n) - number of nodes in the recursion tree
    - Examples: 315(hard)
- *sort an almost sorted array where two elements are swapped
    - Examples: 99
- wiggle sort
    - Example: 280-Wiggle Sort

    - monotonically increasing/decreasing stack
        - comparison:
            - eg: 496,503-Next Greater Element I/II; 1063-Number of Valid Subarrays; 739-Daily Temperatures; 901-Online Stock Span; 456-132 Pattern; 1019-Next Greater Node In Linked List, 1130-Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values; 
        - smallest/largest number formed by subsequence:
            -eg. 1673-Find the Most Competitive Subsequence; 402-Remove K Digits
        - window max/min (with monotonically increasing/decreasing stack)
            - intuition: it is very useful to get "next bigger item", "next smaller item", "previous bigger item", "previous smaller item" and therefore "window max" and "window min"
            - eg: 42-Trapping Rain Water; 84-Largest Rectangle in Histogram; 907-Sum of Subarray Minimums; 1856-Maximum Subarray Min-Product(similar:907); 962-Maximum Width Ramp; 1124-Longest Well-Performing Interval

- tips:
    hashmap or two-pointers
- variations:
    - running counter (with hashmap): 
        - key words: number of ways to get target sum/product
        - eg: 1577-Number of Ways Where Square of Number Is Equal to Product of Two Numbers

## Topological Sort:
    - algorithm: 
        1. build node graph and increase indegrees
        2. add nodes with indegrees == 0 to queuq
        3. while q, pop node and bfs search neighbors of nodes, decrease their indegrees by 1, if indegree turns to 0, append to q
    - key words: construct sequence

    - two arrays: 1537-Get the Maximum Score; 1868-Product of Two Run-Length Encoded Arrays
    - sliding window (see "## sliding window")

## Tree - Recursion can usually be used. 
- If using dfs, has to decide which to use: in-order traversal (aka. dfs), post-order traversal (549,1740), and pre-order traversal (298, search tree). Time complexity is O(n): every node is visited once. Space complexity is O(n) in worst case and O(log(n)) in average case: The extra space comes from implicit stack space due to recursion. For a skewed binary tree, the recursion could go up to n levels deep. 
If using bfs, usually uses a FIFO queue to store nodes to be visited. 
- Problems:
    - pre-order: 297-Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree; 449. Serialize and Deserialize BST; 951-Flip Equivalent Binary Trees; 1008-Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal; 1110-Delete Nodes And Return Forest;

        - complete binary tree
            - eg: 919-Complete Binary Tree Inserter
    - Subtree hashing: 652-Find Duplicate Subtrees

## Trie
- when to use: Trie could use less space compared to hashmap when storing many keys with the same prefix (word search, spell checker, etc.)
- Trie data structure
```
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.isWord = False # mark word end
        self.children = collections.defaultdict(TrieNode)
```
- eg: 211-Design Add and Search Words Data Structure(basic)

## Union Find
- key word: connected group in a graph
- algorithm: union find by rank (assign node with higher rank as parent of a connected group)
```
parents = [i for i in range(n)]
        
def find(x):
    if parents[x] != x:
        parents[x] = find(parents[x]) # recursion
    return parents[x]

# simple version: when only need to find pair-wise connection (don't need a universal parent for all items in a connected part)
def union(x, y):
    px, py = find(x), find(y)
    if px != py: # connect parents of x, y
        parents[px] = py

# todo: full verion - assign parents by rank (guarantees that all connected items have the same parent)

def isXandYConnected(n):
    if shouldConnectXandY(x, y):
        union(x, y)
    
    return find(x) == find(y) # bubble up to parents
